# CSA Challenge
Images from Canada's very first satellite, Alouette-I, have been digitized! This data has rich historical value and is of interest to scientists today. The images can help us study how activity in the ionosphere can interfere with satellite signals for navigation, positioning and communications.
Your challenge? Go back in time and create a tool that will decipher the numeric and the Binary Digital Coding (BDC) used in 1963. Your tool will help manage the thousands of ionosphere images recently scanned by the CSA.
